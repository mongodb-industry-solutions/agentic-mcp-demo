# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A multi-agent AI orchestration demo for multi-industry use cases. The system uses a ReAct-based orchestrator that dynamically discovers MCP (Model Context Protocol) services, routes queries via MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, maintains conversation memory, and invokes tools across pluggable domain services.

## Setup & Running

**Required environment variables:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your openai api token>"
export MONGODB_URI="<your mdb connection string>"
export VOYAGE_API_KEY="<your voyage api token>"   # used by restaurant_guide service
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # optional, defaults to gpt-4o
```

**Install and run:**
```bash
python -m venv <dir>
source <dir>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Watch live agent activity (separate terminal):**
```bash
curl -sN https://notify.bjjl.dev/receive | sed -n 's/^data: //p'
```

There is no test suite or linter configured — this is a prototype/demo project.

## Architecture

### Entry Points
- `main.py` — Interactive CLI loop; supports `status`, `memory`, `exit`, or natural language queries
- `agents/orchestrator.py` — `OrchestratorAgent` class; the core brain
- `mcp_servers/*.py` — Pluggable FastMCP service modules
- `web/portfolio_dashboard.py` — FastAPI + WebSocket dashboard for the portfolio service, driven by MongoDB Change Streams (run separately on `localhost:8050`)
- `web/ibn_dashboard.py` — FastAPI + WebSocket dashboard for the Intent-Based Networking demo, driven by Change Streams across `ibn_intents`, `ibn_compliance_events`, `ibn_telemetry`, `ibn_policy_snapshots` (run separately on `localhost:8060`; supports `?mode=eng` and `?mode=exec`)
- `web/dtw_dashboard.py` — FastAPI + WebSocket dashboard for the Digital Twin (ACME what-if) demo, driven by Change Streams on `dtw_scenarios` (run separately on `localhost:8080`; supports `?mode=eng` and `?mode=exec`)
- `seed/ibn_seed.py` — One-shot loader for the IBN demo fixtures (sites, customers, resources, knowledge_chunks, intents). Run once before starting the demo; supports `--reset`
- `seed/dtw_seed.py` — One-shot loader for the Digital Twin demo fixtures (plans, QoS profiles, network elements, topology edges, subscribers, traffic models, knowledge chunks, sample scenarios). Run once before starting the DTW demo; supports `--reset`

### Orchestrator Flow (`agents/orchestrator.py`)

1. **Service Registry Sync** (`_sync_registry`): On startup, scans `mcp_servers/` for `.py` files, computes file hashes, derives a `domain` tag from each filename prefix (`ibn_*` → `ibn`, `dtw_*` → `dtw`, singletons get their own one-member domain), and syncs `{server_name, description, domain, file_hash, last_seen}` docs into MongoDB `agent_registry.mcp_services`. Detects new, changed, and deleted services; also backfills `domain` on pre-upgrade registry docs. Embedding of the `description` field is performed automatically by the Atlas Vector Search index (`vector_index`) — the orchestrator passes raw text in `$vectorSearch.query`, and Atlas embeds it on the fly.

2. **Two-Stage Hierarchical Routing** (`_route_query`):

   This is the architectural beat about scale: a single embedding can't disambiguate hundreds of services. Routing is a pipeline.

   - **Stage 1 — Domain classification** (`_classify_domain`): gpt-4o-mini sees the *taxonomy of domains* (3–4 lines per domain, never per-service) and picks 1–2 domains for the query, or all domains if unsure. Scales by tree depth, not leaf count. Skipped when only one domain is registered. The same step also takes a sticky hint from `last_domain` so short follow-ups stay in the current demo.
   - **Stage 2 — Vector search within domain(s)** (`_semantic_search`): `$vectorSearch` against `vector_index` with `filter: {"domain": {"$in": stage1_domains}}` so DTW and IBN never compete on similarity. Top 5 returned with score. If the Atlas index hasn't been re-configured to include `domain` as a filter field, the orchestrator detects the error, flips `_domain_filter_supported = False` for the session, and falls back to unfiltered search with a one-time warning broadcast.
   - **Stage 2 decision tree** (unchanged from the earlier single-stage form, just now scoped to a domain):
     - **Clear winner** — `best_score > 0.65` *and* score gap to runner-up `> 0.03` → return top match without LLM.
     - **Session stickiness** — only when `use_stickiness=True` and `best_score < 0.6` and `last_service` exists → reuse it.
     - **Otherwise (medium confidence)** — LLM validation: gpt-4o-mini picks from the top 5 by description, may return multiple comma-separated services or `NONE`.

   **The story to customers:** Atlas isn't just where the catalog lives — it's where you route through it. Domain classification handles **breadth** (small, stable taxonomy that scales to thousands of services). Per-domain vector search handles **depth** (small-N, high-resolution semantic match). Each scale tier handled by the right Atlas primitive. We don't ask one embedding to disambiguate everything.

   **Atlas index requirement:** the `vector_index` on `agent_registry.mcp_services` must declare `domain` as a filter field for the Stage 2 filter to work. JSON for the Atlas UI: add `{"type": "filter", "path": "domain"}` to the fields array. Until you do, the orchestrator falls back to unfiltered Stage 2 (you'll see a `⚠` line in the live feed).

3. **Follow-up Detection** (`_needs_context_enrichment`): For short queries (< 5 words) that don't start with a self-contained verb (`list`, `show`, `add`, …), asks gpt-4o-mini whether the current query is a follow-up to the previous one. If yes, the query is prepended with the prior user message before re-routing with `use_stickiness=True` — which then makes Stage 1 prefer `last_domain`. Routing and enrichment-detection run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`.

4. **Server Activation** (`_activate_servers`): Launches MCP servers as subprocesses via `uv run` (StdioServerParameters), establishing stdio-based `ClientSession` connections managed by an `AsyncExitStack`. Sessions are reused across queries.

5. **ReAct Loop** (`process_query`): Iterates up to 5 times. Collects tools from all active sessions (prefixed as `{service_name}__{tool_name}`), calls `session.call_tool()` with extracted arguments, and appends results to the message list. Tool definitions are cached per session in `self.tool_cache`.

6. **Live Broadcast**: Posts colored status tags (`BOOTSTRAP`, `QUERY`, `AGENT`, `ROUTING`, `ACTION`, `RESULT`, `ERROR`) to `https://notify.bjjl.dev/send` for the live-feed viewer.

### Adding a New MCP Service

Create a new `.py` file in `mcp_servers/` using the FastMCP framework. The orchestrator auto-discovers it on next startup via hash-based change detection. The file's module-level docstring is used as the service description for semantic routing — make it specific and descriptive.

### IBN Demo (Intent-Based Networking)

A 5-service flow demonstrating Atlas as the operational memory + decision layer between customer intent, network reality, and automated assurance. The five services live alongside the others in `mcp_servers/`:

- `ibn_intent_service` — NL → structured intent (`gpt-4o`), lifecycle management (submit / list / get / cancel)
- `ibn_inventory_service` — sites, resources, topology; geospatial `find_nearby_spare` via 2dsphere
- `ibn_feasibility_service` — match intent against inventory (`check_feasibility`, `propose_plan`, `activate_plan`)
- `ibn_assurance_service` — compliance computation + the **hybrid vector diagnose query** (`diagnose_violation`); also `apply_runbook` and `update_template_version`
- `ibn_telemetry_simulator` — push-button violation injection (`inject_event`, `seed_baseline`, `reset_telemetry`)

**The WOW query** lives in `ibn_assurance_service.diagnose_violation` — a single `$vectorSearch` aggregation stage that combines semantic similarity over `ibn_knowledge_chunks.text`, structured equality on `kind`, a `$gte` time filter on `ts`, and a numeric bounding box on `lng`/`lat` (a 2dsphere isn't used here because Atlas Vector Search filters don't support `$geoWithin`; we precompute lng/lat fields on the chunks and box-filter instead). All four modalities pre-filter the vector search inside the index — this is the architectural beat where Atlas separates from a Postgres + pgvector + PostGIS + TimescaleDB stack.

**Atlas Vector Search index required.** The `ibn_knowledge_index` index on `ibn_knowledge_chunks` must be created in the Atlas UI before the diagnose tool works. The seed script prints the exact JSON config when you run it; the index needs `text` configured as a vector field with auto-embedding (e.g. `voyage-3-large`, 1024 dims) and `kind`, `ts`, `lng`, `lat`, `customer`, `site_id` as filter fields.

**Dashboard modes.** The IBN dashboard reads `?mode=` from the URL. `eng` (default) shows the raw aggregation pipeline modal during diagnose and the parsed-JSON intent block; `exec` hides those, replaces them with prose callouts and a similarity bar without numerical score. Same chat backbone, two render styles for two audiences.

**Demo collections** in `agent_registry`: `ibn_customers`, `ibn_sites` (with `2dsphere` index), `ibn_resources` (with `2dsphere`), `ibn_intents`, `ibn_knowledge_chunks` (vector-indexed in Atlas UI), `ibn_policy_snapshots`, `ibn_compliance_events`, `ibn_telemetry` (a Time Series collection — created by the seed script).

### DTW Demo (Digital Twin — ACME Mobile what-if simulations)

A 5-service flow building a **digital twin** of ACME Mobile's HLR/HSS-relevant world in MongoDB, then letting an LLM + MCP agents run what-if simulations on it. The pitch focus is two realistic scenarios:

- **Flow A (QoS uplift):** "Raise prepaid ACME M downlink from 7.2 Mbps to 20 Mbps in NYC and LA Saturday evening — where do we bottleneck?"
- **Flow B (Policy change):** "Migrate ACME M to a new APN, update the PCRF template, and enable Canada roaming — what control-plane pressure do we expect?"

The five services live alongside the others in `mcp_servers/`:

- `dtw_plan_service` — plans, QoS profiles, subscriber samples (`describe_plan`, `get_qos_profile`, `list_plans`, `compare_qos_profiles`, `subscribers_for_plan`)
- `dtw_topology_service` — RAN + core inventory and dependency graph; wraps `$graphLookup` over `dtw_topology_edges` (`get_network_element`, `find_cells_in_market`, `traverse_dependencies`, `find_path_between`, `list_markets`)
- `dtw_traffic_service` — per-cell traffic models and load estimation by time window (`get_traffic_model`, `estimate_cell_load`, `list_time_windows`, `peak_hours_for_market`)
- `dtw_scenario_service` — NL → structured what-if scenario (`gpt-4o`); lifecycle (`create_scenario`, `list_scenarios`, `get_scenario`, `cancel_scenario`)
- `dtw_simulation_service` — the **hero**. `simulate_qos_change` runs `$graphLookup` for scope + per-cell load projection from `dtw_traffic_models` + hybrid `$vectorSearch` against `dtw_knowledge_chunks` for analogous past scenarios — in one tool call. `simulate_roaming_change` does the Flow B control-plane variant. Also `diff_scenarios`, `get_simulation_result`

**The WOW combo** in `dtw_simulation_service.simulate_qos_change`: $graphLookup walks the dependency tree from `plan_ACME_M` downstream through QoS → cells → eNBs → SGW → PGW, while a hybrid `$vectorSearch` against `dtw_knowledge_chunks.text` (with structured pre-filters on `segment`, `market`, `kind`) surfaces semantically similar past incidents and their mitigation runbooks. Graph for *operational structure*, vector for *institutional memory* — both in one Atlas store, both invoked at simulate-time.

**Atlas Vector Search index required.** The `dtw_knowledge_index` on `dtw_knowledge_chunks` must be created in the Atlas UI before the hybrid query works. The seed script prints the exact JSON config; the index needs `text` configured with auto-embedding (`voyage-3-large`, 1024 dims) and `kind`, `segment`, `market`, `plan_id`, `ts`, `lng`, `lat` as filter fields. If the index isn't ready, `simulate_qos_change` still runs and persists graph + load projections — only the "similar past scenarios" panel will be empty.

**Dashboard modes.** The DTW dashboard reads `?mode=` from the URL. `eng` (default) shows the raw aggregation pipeline and the graph-walk edge list; `exec` hides those and renders only narrative panels with a similarity bar (no numerical score).

**Demo collections** in `agent_registry`: `dtw_markets`, `dtw_plans`, `dtw_qos_profiles`, `dtw_subscribers`, `dtw_network_elements` (polymorphic — HSS/HLR/MME/SGW/PGW/eNodeB/Cell in one collection), `dtw_topology_edges` (the dependency graph), `dtw_traffic_models`, `dtw_scenarios`, `dtw_knowledge_chunks` (vector-indexed in Atlas UI).

## Key Dependencies

- `mcp` — Model Context Protocol client/server framework
- `openai` — AsyncOpenAI client for chat completions (orchestrator uses `gpt-4o` by default for ReAct + `gpt-4o-mini` for routing/enrichment validation)
- `voyageai` — used directly only by `restaurant_guide` (`voyage-3-large` for ad-hoc embedding); the main `vector_index` does its own auto-embedding inside Atlas
- `pymongo` — MongoDB async driver
- `rich` — Terminal UI rendering
- `httpx` — Async HTTP for broadcast notifications

Dependencies are managed via `requirements.in` (source) and `requirements.txt` (pinned). To update: edit `requirements.in` then recompile with `pip-compile`.
